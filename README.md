In many real-world scenarios, organizations need to predict binary outcomes based on historical data — such as customer churn, loan default, or risk classification.

This project demonstrates how logistic regression can be used to predict survival probability using passenger attributes from the Titanic dataset.
The focus is not the dataset itself, but the end-to-end classification workflow.

The project follows a structured machine learning pipeline:

1. Data loading and exploration
2. Handling missing values
3. Feature selection and encoding
4. Train-test split
5. Model training using Logistic Regression
6. Model evaluation using classification metrics

This mirrors how classification problems are handled in real-world analytics and ML roles.

Tech Stack

1. Python
2. Pandas & NumPy – data manipulation
3. Matplotlib / Seaborn – data visualization
4. Scikit-learn – model building and evaluation

The model was evaluated on unseen test data using standard metrics.

Accuracy Score: 0.87
Confusion Matrix:
 [[ 5  8]
 [ 3 21]]

An accuracy of 87% indicates strong predictive capability for a baseline classification model.
